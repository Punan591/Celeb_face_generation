# Celeb_face_generation
Celeb_face_generation_description:
In this project we are using the dataset of celeb face images.Here I use DCGAN model architecture to generate realistic looking celeb faces.
In this model architecture there are two neural networks one is generator and another is discriminator.The generator wants to fool the discriminator by generating realistic looking images.Whereas the discriminator try to identify real and fake images more accurately.By doing these processes the generator at one point can make itself more perfect by making the discriminator fool and can generate more realistic looking celeb images.This process is similar like somebody is telling you that you are not perfect in one part of your work and you then try hard to find out the fault of yours and become more accurate in your that section of work
